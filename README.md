# 🧹 Autonomous Vacuum Cleaner Robot

## 🚀 Project Overview
This project is a simple **autonomous vacuum cleaner robot** built using an **Arduino**.  
It continuously moves forward using four DC motors while a separate motor powers a **vacuum mechanism** to clean debris along the way.

---

## 🔧 Key Components
- **Arduino Board:** Acts as the brain of the robot, running the control logic.  
- **DC Motors (x4):** Drive the robot forward.  
- **Vacuum Motor:** Operates the cleaning mechanism.  
- **Motor Driver (Adafruit Motor Shield):** Manages motor speed and direction for both locomotion and the vacuum system.

---

## ⚙️ Working
Once powered on, the robot:
1. Moves forward autonomously using four DC motors.  
2. Simultaneously activates the vacuum motor to clean surfaces.  

---

## ✅ Conclusion
A basic but effective prototype demonstrating the **integration of movement and cleaning features** using **Arduino** and **motor control**.
