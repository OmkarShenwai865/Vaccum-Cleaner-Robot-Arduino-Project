Autonomous Vacuum Cleaner Robot
🧹 Project Overview
This project is a simple autonomous vacuum cleaner robot built using an Arduino. It continuously moves forward using four DC motors while a separate motor powers a vacuum mechanism to clean debris along the way.

🔧 Key Components:
Arduino Board: Acts as the brain of the robot, running the control logic.

DC Motors (x4): Drive the robot forward.

Vacuum Motor: Operates the cleaning mechanism.

Motor Driver (Adafruit Motor Shield): Manages motor speed and direction for both locomotion and the vacuum system.

🚀 Working:
Once powered on, the robot:

Moves forward autonomously using four DC motors.

Simultaneously activates the vacuum motor to clean surfaces.

✅ Conclusion:
A basic but effective prototype demonstrating the integration of movement and cleaning features using Arduino and motor control.
